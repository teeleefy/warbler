# Warbler-  A Twitter Clone!
This exercise is intended to extend a somewhat-functioning Twitter clone. It is intended to give you practice reading and understanding an existing application, as well as fixing bugs in it, writing tests for it, and extending it with new features.
## Setup
Create the Python virtual environment:

```
  $ python3 -m venv venv
  $ source venv/bin/activate
  (venv) $ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Important Note:
If you are using Python 3.8 instead of 3.7, then you will have issues with installing some of the packages in the requirements.txt file into your virtual environment.
For users using Python 3.8, we recommend deleting pyscopg2-binary from the requirements.txt file, and using pip install pyscopg2-binary in the terminal in order to successfully install this package.
