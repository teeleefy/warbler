3. In followers.html, following.html, and index.html, showed bio by accessing users.bio with jinja.
4. Edit Profile button: On app.py def profile(), updated to require login to view edit form and authenticate user by password and update edited profile details.

7. Fixed cancel-button on edit profile page.  Made it redirect to user profile. 
8. Added functionality to like icons next to messages. Edited it to where only messages not posted by user will have like icon.  When clicked, like icon will basically toggle(add or delete) that message from users.likes.

13. Changed search function in nav bar to 'ilike' to find users regardless of capitalization of username. 
14. On index.html, removed follow button for g.user so user cannot follow himself.
